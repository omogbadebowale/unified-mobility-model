## Description

This repository contains Python code, datasets, and nonlinear fitting routines implementing a unified mobility model that quantitatively describes grain-boundary-limited charge transport in polycrystalline thermoelectric materials.

The model integrates:
- Thermionic grain boundary barriers (ΦGB)
- Finite grain boundary widths (wGB)
- Temperature-dependent phonon scattering (p exponent)
- Weighted carrier mobility (μw)

The model is demonstrated on multiple material systems:
- ZnO
- Bi₂Te₃
- Mg₂Si
- SnSe
- PbTe
